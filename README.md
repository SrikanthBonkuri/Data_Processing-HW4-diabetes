# hw-diabetes

## Goals:

* Model-selection techniques using the diabetes dataset
* Comparison of feature ranking with $R^2$, forward selection and Lasso
* PCR (principal component regression) with cross validation to assess feature dimension

## Assignment

Use the diabetes dataset from [sklearn.datasets.load_diabetes](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_diabetes.html) to answer the questions below.

## Question 1

Rank the features according to their squared correlation with the target. 
Note that squared correlation is the same as $R^2$ for univariate regression. 
Visualize the ordered scores with a bar chart.

## Question 2

Rank the features according to the order that they're added in the [forward sequential feature selection](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.SequentialFeatureSelector.html) algorithm. Use this ranking to reorder the bar chart in question 1.

## Question 3

Compare the bar charts in Questions 1 & 2.
Briefly discuss differences between the two charts and possible causes.
Add a figure to prove your point.

## Question 4

Plot cross-validation scores versus the number of components used in Principal Component Regression (PCR). 
(Recall the [PCR vs PLS](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/cross_decomposition/plot_pcr_vs_pls.html)
demo mentioned in class.)
Include both training and test scores.
Comment on the dimensionality of the dataset and the degree of overfitting.
Hint: The [CV-diabetes demo](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/exercises/plot_cv_diabetes.html),
which uses cross-validation to determine the best `alpha`, may be helpful in answering this question.

## Question 5

The [lasso lars demo](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/linear_model/plot_lasso_lars.html) computes and plots the coefficients with lasso. Add a legend to the plot so that you can relate colors to feature names. Briefly compare the lasso ordering to your answers above.
